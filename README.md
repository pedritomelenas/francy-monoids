# francy-monoids

A GAP package with graphic tools related to commutative monoids

This package requires [francy](https://github.com/mcmartins/francy) and [numericalsgps](https://github.com/gap-packages/numericalsgps).

## Implemented tools

- Functions to draw hasse diagrams of the integers with the order relation of a numerical semigroup. See `hasse_diagrams.g`.
- Functions to draw the tree of the sons of a numerical semigroup. See `tree_semigroups.g`.
- Functions to draw the graphs of an element of a numerical semigroup. See `graphs_element.g`.
- Functions to draw the tree of gluings of a numerical semigroup. See `gluings.g`.

## Examples

See the examples directory for a jupyter notebook and a gap file with examples.
